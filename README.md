## CRAFTIN

# Description

This repo translates the Java code of the first part of the book

*Robert Nystrom: Crafting Interpreters (2021)*

into Go. It is the source code of an interpreter with GC for a 
model language called *Lox*.

# Usage

After building, either provide a file path to a text file as a 
single command line argument or nothing in which case the app 
will enter the interactive mode. Then enter a text. Exit with
CTRL + C.

Note that this repo is under development, the app will be rudimentary
until further notice.
